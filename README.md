# Adversarial-Robustness-for-Agricultural-and-Medical-Dataset-Research_Paper_Based
This project presents a deep learning-based image classification system designed to be robust against adversarial attacks,
applied across two critical domains: medical diagnosis and agricultural disease detection. Using CNN architectures, the model
classifies brain tumors from MRI scans and detects diseases in betel leaf images with high accuracy. To improve reliability in
real-world scenarios, adversarial training techniques like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) are employed, making the model
resilient to maliciously perturbed inputs. The system is evaluated through extensive metrics, including confusion matrices, 
accuracy/loss plots, and classification reports, demonstrating strong generalization and minimal overfitting. This work 
highlights the importance of adversarial robustness for secure and trustworthy AI deployment in healthcare and agriculture.
